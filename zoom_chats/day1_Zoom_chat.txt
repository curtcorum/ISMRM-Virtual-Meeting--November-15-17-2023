09:40:58 From Nivedita Naresh To Everyone:
	in terms of the magnetization preparation modules, how are the differences between the various vendors handled especially for arbitrary pulse shapes? Also do the specifications about the scanners need to be included in the validation block before the sequences can be run since each vendor also has multiple scanner models with different hardware limits?
09:44:58 From Marlon Perez To Everyone:
	what is the gradRasterTime for Bruker?
09:45:27 From Marlon Perez To Everyone:
	Which are the dimensionals of the RF amplitude?
09:47:53 From Hu Cheng To Everyone:
	There are many parameters for the gradient that are interrelated, what is the best way in specifying a gradient?
09:50:35 From Qingping Chen To Everyone:
	Replying to "There are many param..."
	
	It depends on what you want to set for the Gradient. For example, if you set for the flatTopTime and flatArea, other Parameters will be set automatically.
09:50:35 From Yixuan Liu To Everyone:
	In the mr.makeTrapezoid(). How do you define sys?

	The sys has been set at the begining of the sequence script. You can set for slew rate, max Gradient, rfRingdownTime, etc. You can use mr.makeTrapeyoid(...'system', sys) to set for it. You can have a close look at it in the following presenatation.

09:56:47 From Moritz Zai√ü To Everyone:
	Replying to "Sorry for the rudime..."
	
	Matlab or Python?
09:56:51 From Hande Halilibrahimoglu To Everyone:
	Very naive question: Are function names and usage in matlab and python the same?
09:57:57 From Qingping Chen To Everyone:
	Replying to "Sorry for the rudime..."
	
	Thanks for the Question. There is a Pulseq tutorial here√ñ: https://github.com/pulseq/tutorials. where you see the detailed instruction on how to install for matlab
09:58:10 From Moritz Zai√ü To Everyone:
	Replying to "Very naive question:..."
	
	they are very similar, but not 100% the same.
09:58:17 From Zoona Javed To Everyone:
	I sort of missed how to chose the raster start point from the start or center. Do I define it in the code somewhere ?

10:02:12 From Patrick Schuenke To Everyone:
	Replying to "Sorry for the rudime..."
	
	PyPulseq can be installed directly from PyPi using the simple command "pip install pypulseq". However, I highly recommend to use the latest PyPulseq version directly from the GitHub page. Either clone and install it, or simply use "pip install git+https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq"

	Each sequence is a concatenation of non-overlapping blocks. So they are played out sequentially. But each block can have several events (e.g. RF + Grad, multiple Grads, Grad + ADC...)

10:05:08 From Qingping Chen To Everyone:

	thanks for the Question. We can not "choose" the raster start Point from the start or Center. When we excuete the sequence in Scanners, the scanner always samples at the center of the raster cell.

10:08:20 From Andreas Voskrebenzev (MHH) To Everyone:
	Regarding System Definitions. I think the limits are defined independent of axis (x,y,z), but e.g. the gradient can have different strenghts in different directions. Any way to deal with this issue effectively while using the grads with max settings? Do I miss something?		Also is there a library for common systems?
10:09:39 From Moritz Zai√ü To Everyone:
	we will have a Q&A at the end of the session to try to answer all your Questions. they are collected here:	https://github.com/pulseq/ISMRM-Virtual-Meeting--November-15-17-2023/discussions
10:12:20 From Qingping Chen To Everyone:
	Replying to "Can you use gradient..."
	
	yes. The scaling will multiply the Gradient shape with many points with a scaling factor.
10:13:53 From Qingping Chen To Everyone:

10:20:50 From Maxim Terekhov To Everyone:
	Nice talks ! I have question : Is there a way in Pulseq  to work with Triggered events (physiological signals such as ECG and external triggers) ? The same question is regarding   generating output triggers ( e.g for fMRI)
10:22:57 From Maxim Zaitsev To Everyone:
	Pulseq supports trigger input objects, it is possible to use cardio or breathing (or any other phisio signal) for triggering
10:25:28 From Laurent Lamalle To Everyone:
	How do you scale your RF Tx power to achieve a prescribed flip angle, from a previous reference calibration?
10:26:37 From Maxim Terekhov To Everyone:
	Maxim thank you, one more question, do one need to recompile Pulseq with some optins to make possible access to the nuclei tab in Special parameter card, to use pulseq for X-nuclei ?
10:27:49 From Barry To Everyone:
	Hi, when experimenting in a real scanner, we often need to rotate for shift the position based on a location sequence, how the rotation and shift thing get supported in Pulseq?
10:30:08 From Moritz Zai√ü To Everyone:
	Replying to "Hi, when experimenti..."
	
	Educational answer: you can of Course Code this, by rotating the Gradient Events or changing the slice selection pulse frequency etc. 	Maxim will hae a more practical answer that depends on the Interpreter.

10:38:14 From Sultan Zaman Mahmud To Everyone:
	Replying to "Hi, when experimenti..."
	
	The parameters like FOV, slice thickness can not be changed during the actual scan, is that correct? Or they can be changed on the scanner?
10:39:52 From Moritz Zai√ü To Everyone:
	Replying to "Hi, when experimenti..."
	
	this depends on the Interpreter: The Siemens Interpreter allows a live Adjustment at the scanner of the FOV position.

11:04:39 From Sultan Zaman Mahmud To Everyone:
	Would off-center imaging using non-Cartesian (i.e. spiral) trajectory work? Does it take care of the 'frequenctproportinaltogradient' we have to use for Siemens programming?
11:06:20 From Qingping Chen To Everyone:
	Replying to "Hi, when experimenti..."
	
	@Sultan Zaman Mahmud The Parameters like FOV; slice thickness, flip angle, TE, TR, etc. can not be adjusted in the scanner. You Need to modify in the sequence source Code and reproduce a .seq file.
