10:43:43 From Bilal Tasdelen To Everyone:
	As a reminder, you can also post your questions on GitHub discussions: https://github.com/pulseq/ISMRM-Virtual-Meeting--November-15-17-2023/discussions‚Ä®‚Ä®We tried to copied the questions and answers on chat to discussion. Feel free to check it out!
10:52:45 From AV To Everyone:
	Will this also work with T-PAT Grappa?
10:53:38 From Maxim Zaitsev To Everyone:
	we don't know, we've never tried ;-)
10:53:47 From AV To Everyone:
	Reacted to "we don't know, we've..." with üòÇ
10:54:00 From Jon-Fredrik Nielsen To Maxim Zaitsev(Privately):
	Could you save the chat log after the meeting -- my Zoom died and I now see only the last few messages
10:54:06 From AV To Everyone:
	Replying to "Will this also work ..."
	
	Ok, we will find out ;-)
10:54:33 From Maxim Zaitsev To Jon-Fredrik Nielsen(Privately):
	Jokes aside: probably it would require some additional work, but probably it is not too difficult
10:54:50 From Maxim Zaitsev To Jon-Fredrik Nielsen(Privately):
	yes, I'll try to think of it
11:03:16 From Jody Todd To Everyone:
	How about partial Fourier acquisitions?
11:04:21 From Maxim Zaitsev / Qingping Chen To Everyone:
	Replying to "How about partial Fo..."
	
	In principle, partial Fourier acq. is possible. But due to the limited time, we did not verify this yet.
11:08:10 From Maxim Zaitsev To Everyone:
	BTW, all presentations are readily available on gitHub -- here: https://github.com/pulseq/ISMRM-Virtual-Meeting--November-15-17-2023/tree/main/slides
11:10:43 From Magdoom Kulam To Everyone:
	Are the python and MATLAB versions of pulseq identical?
11:10:55 From Magdoom Kulam To Everyone:
	In terms of functionality
11:12:46 From Maxim Zaitsev To Everyone:
	they are very close but not identical. Sravan is doing really great job in trying to align them. We mostly use the Matlab version here in Freiburg, but we also have 2-3 Python enthusiasts in the group, who use pypulseq
11:13:52 From Bilal Tasdelen To Everyone:
	Replying to "Are the python and M..."
	
	They are mostly identical in terms of the basic functionality, and designed to give the exact same .seq file.‚Ä®‚Ä®At the moment some newer functions of the Matlab version has not been implemented on PyPulseq yet.
11:17:09 From Shohei Fujita To Everyone:
	As a reminder, feel free to post questions to: https://github.com/pulseq/ISMRM-Virtual-Meeting--November-15-17-2023/discussions/categories/questions-for-the-q-a-sessions
	We will discuss the answers in the Q/A session.
11:25:06 From Zhengguo Tan To Everyone:
	Sorry to interrupt. Perhaps a stupid question:‚Ä®‚Ä®If mb=6 and caipishiftZ=2, there would be 3 slices that you don't sample at all. Could this be the case?
11:34:22 From Nivedita Naresh To Everyone:
	is ghost correction implemented
11:36:28 From Zhengguo Tan To Everyone:
	Thank you!
11:36:29 From Nivedita Naresh To Everyone:
	what type of functional stimuli have you been able to resolve using the EPI technique for fMRI?
11:37:48 From Jody Todd To Everyone:
	Is there an SMS seq for Siemens as well?
11:38:42 From Thomas Roos To Everyone:
	The pTx on Philips, that will be presented tommorow is done at 7T!
11:39:33 From Marlon Perez To Everyone:
	Reacted to "Is there an SMS se..." with üëÄ
11:39:35 From Jon-Fredrik Nielsen To Everyone:
	Replying to "Is there an SMS seq ..."
	
	Yes, the demo I showed first produces the file sms-epi.seq.
11:39:50 From Marlon Perez To Everyone:
	Reacted to "Yes, the demo I sh..." with üëç
11:39:55 From Jody Todd To Everyone:
	Reacted to "Yes, the demo I show..." with üëç
11:40:23 From Chu-Yu Lee To Everyone:
	are there any differences in saving/reading archieve files using Pulseq on GE compared with EPIC?  for example, loadecho
11:40:28 From Bolin Qin To Everyone:
	Replying to "The pTx on Philips, ..."
	
	Hope for the pTx on Siemens üëç
11:40:48 From Bolin Qin To Everyone:

11:42:31 From Moritz Zai√ü To Everyone:
	ptx pypulseq prototype:		https://gitlab.cs.fau.de/mrzero/pypulseq_rfshim.git
11:42:44 From Tian LI To Everyone:
	Is the TOPPE platform you just demonstrated avaliable to all of us? Or can we only use it when we get the license from GE?
11:42:53 From Jody Todd To Everyone:
	Is there a way to simulate the slice excitation profiles?
11:43:58 From Yuan To Everyone:
	Reacted to "ptx pypulseq prototy..." with üëç
11:44:31 From Tian LI To Everyone:
	Thank you~
11:45:27 From Nivedita Naresh To Everyone:
	can the virtual scanner be used to see if the sequences are running

	requires a separate Version of pypulseq and Interpreter though.

	Very cool! Has anyone thusfar implemented 'full' pTx? (besides me, as I'll present tommorow)
11:55:12 From Jon-Fredrik Nielsen To Everyone:
