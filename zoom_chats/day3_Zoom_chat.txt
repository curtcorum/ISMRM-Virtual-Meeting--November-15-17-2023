09:03:00 From Magdoom Kulam To Everyone:
	Maybe I missed it, it would be helpful if a demo can be shown for how to use the Siemens interpreter from the generated seq file.
09:06:47 From Jonathan Endres To Everyone:
	You can find more information about the simulation and how to execute the shown examples yourself here: https://github.com/pulseq/ISMRM-Virtual-Meeting--November-15-17-2023/tree/main/tutorials/day3_Pulseq_sim_in_python
09:09:03 From Maxim Zaitsev To Everyone:
	I am happy to show in a bit more detail how to simulate sequences in IDEA in the frame of the last slot today (Q&A in the end of the meeting)

	One question from yesterday~ As for the HarmonizedMRI/SMS-EPI and HarmonizedMRI/3DEPI displayed by Nielsen in SMS-EPI demo yesterday, we didn't find relevant resources on github. Is it possible for us to get the coressponding access?
10:25:59 From Abbas Moghaddam To Everyone:

11:48:03 From Seyedeh Nasim Adnani To Everyone:
	Than you for the nice presentations. Is it possible to generate T2* maps online? Like adding a post-processing script to the reconstructions and generate the maps?

	Bilal and Shoei
11:50:06 From Seyedeh Nasim Adnani To Everyone:

11:52:17 From Jens Rosenberg To Everyone:
	Thank you!!
11:52:41 From Amir Seginer To Everyone:
	Can a .seq file be copied between vendors, or does it have to generated per vendor? (E.g, because of different raster times.)
11:55:00 From Nivedita Naresh To Everyone:
	in terms of standardization, what are your thoughts about standardizing sequences. Usually, from a user point of view, that is the main observation that there are too many techniques and its difficult completely understand the minute differences. However, the popularity of some of the other modalities is because of the minimalistic number of techniques available.
11:55:01 From Amir Seginer To Everyone:
	Thanks.
11:57:05 From Nivedita Naresh To Everyone:
	also have some of the pulseq techniques been approved to be used in patients

12:00:10 From Magdoom Kulam To Everyone:
	How to generate .dll and .so files to run on the scanner?
12:01:43 From Jens Rosenberg To Everyone:
	Does the .seq file need to be complied in IDEA to run on the scanner or can i just upload the .seq on the scanner interface?
12:02:55 From Jens Rosenberg To Everyone:
	..if i have the pulseq C2P
12:02:58 From Laurent Lamalle To Everyone:
	Thank you very much to all of you for this very interesting workshop!
12:03:05 From Maxim Zaitsev / Qingping Chen To Everyone:
